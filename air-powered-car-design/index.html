<p><strong>Air Powered Car Design</strong>, In case of our engineering project Baloon-Powered Car the action is air rushing from the straw and pushing against the air behind the car while the reaction is air rushed behind the car through the straw pushing against the car with the same force causing the car in motion towards forward movement. One propelled by an elastic band around the axel or a balloon-powered car which doesnt directly power the wheels. Conclusion Air powered cars is a realization of latest technology in automobile field.</p>

<h3 id="one-tank-lasts-over-125-miles-200-km">One tank lasts over 125 miles 200 km.</h3><p>Since this is an engineering project you need to specify your design requirements. Primary school pupils investigate which model car design is faster. The Airpod has a 175 liter storage tank of compressed air that you refill with an external pump or with an electric motor that can refuel the car while its in motion. The Hybrid Air system uses compressed air to move the cars wheels when driving under 43 mph. Try it several times then try changing the design to see if you can get it to go farther or faster. Up next well examine what makes CO2 dragsters go.</p>
