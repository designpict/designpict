<p><strong>Agile Design Patterns</strong>, When viewed from the Agile perspective we can see that design patterns and architecture are related in that both are about accommodating change over time. This book presents a series of case studies illustrating the fundamentals of Agile development and Agile design and moves quickly from UML models to real C code. Although patterns at one time were thought of as a design up-front technique they can be used in Agile projects to encapsulate variations that are discovered over time.</p>
