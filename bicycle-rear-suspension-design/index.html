In this article well be discussing a new Bicycle Rear Suspension design patent filed by Specialized Bicycles US patent 10850798. This major version number has been around since 2013 but the software is always improving so now you have almost all the bike suspension systems available including special rail systems or variations of the MacPherson strut and as complex as 6-bar suspension systems. One of the biggest evolutions in mountain bike technology since about 1990 has been rear suspension designs. The objective of this study is to design and develop a proper geometry of rear suspension system for mountain bike and to study the motion mechanisms of rear suspension system. The suspension designs are a two dimensional concept with each bar linkage connected by pivots two and three bar linkages do not permit movement.</p>

<p>What we enjoy today with so many bikes that have suspension designs that work so well is a result of many years of suspension that teased us with its potential but overall did not deliver. Treks design is similar to the Split Pivot design that is patented by Dave Weagle of DW-link fame. This major version number has been around since 2013 but the software is always improving so now you have almost all the bike suspension systems available including special rail systems or variations of the MacPherson strut and as complex as 6-bar suspension systems. The most obvious difference with this design is that the bottom bracket and therefore the entire drivetrain is positioned on a link between the front and rear triangles.

<p>Even the holy grail of dual-suspension has been attempted with the goal of suspending the rear wheel without altering the action of pedaling. The objective of this study is to design and develop a proper geometry of rear suspension system for mountain bike and to study the motion mechanisms of rear suspension system. Force exerted at the pedals of a bike cause an increase in vertical and horizontal ground reaction forces at the rear wheel and also an increase in chain tension.
