Maintenance departments of producing companies in most industrial countries are facing challenges originating from an aging workforce increasing product variety and the pressure to increase productivity. The development of the user interface did also include the hardware used for interaction with the system. The design process starts by imagining how workers will use augmented reality to solve a problem. AR has a ton of potential when designing meaningful experiences since it allows a user to become fully immersed inside a moment. When it comes to augmented reality design many designers try to invent and use new and unexpected interaction patterns.</p>
