<p>In this course we will explore the basics of visual design theory why its needed and how to apply it to your visual design projects as well as the difference between art and design. Design is made up of basic elements built into a structure that communicates a message. These elements are the building blocks you need to construct your design. Waterline contours below the design waterline can generally be thought of as the path water takes as it interacts with the hull bottom creating lift and drag at speed.</p>
<h3 id="by-using-two-colors-with-the-greatest-visual-contrast-each-hue-is-made-more-vivid-as-a-result">By using two colors with the greatest visual contrast each hue is made more vivid as a result.</h3><p>Straighter waterlines in the aft section of the hulls running bottom mean a shorter more efficient path for water to take along the bottom resulting in less drag. These objects can be arranged in any way as part of your composition. Predict the future behavior of their design to meet some specified need. While a learning theory wont answer all of your design problems it offers clarity throughout your process and directs you toward finding solutions. Design theory involves an understanding of the tangible elements including form space proportion color scale texture structure grid composition line shape and volume and how to arrange them to achieve balance rhythm pattern hierarchy emphasis and unity. Of the many eLearning theories that influence the practice three of them are used by professionals on a daily basis.</p>
