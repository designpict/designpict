<p><strong>Antenna Tuning Unit Design</strong>, I intended to design my homebrew antenna tuner to suit my specific antenna system situation instead of using a more universal design which is a one-size-fits-all device normally intended to be useful in most circumstances but generally only with reasonably well-designed HF antennas. Float the tuner from ground and install a balun at the input end. The antenna cable length should be designed according to application demands.</p>

<p>The function of the antenna tuner is to transform the complex impedance presented by the antenna or its feeder system to a resistive value suitable to load the transmitter. First of all construct the antenna mount. Float the tuner from ground and install a balun at the input end. I have used this ATU for a variety of longwire antennas including outdoor antennas of various lengths and much shorter indoor attic antennas.</p>

<p>An antenna tuner or antenna tuning unit is a network of variable inductors and capacitors that can be altered to counterbalance the effects of the inductive and capacitive elements of the antenna with the aim of making the antenna appear as a resistive load of 50Ω. It is made from a 18 thick aluminum plate cut to 2 x 6. The wireless range that an end-customer gets out of an RF product with a current-limited power source such as a coin-cell battery depends greatly on the antenna design the enclosure and a good PCB layout. Directional coupler The main design issue of the directional coupler is to sense the incident and reﬂected powers with a reasonable power level required for an RF power detector while delivering the input power to the antennawithminimumlossFortheconcomitantweak couplings a coupled-line coupler is.

<p>LBA Antenna Tuning Units for higher power or which include complex filter or switching systems are typically designed as modular systems for field installation in customer provided buildings or LBA modular buildings. The function of the antenna tuner is to transform the complex impedance presented by the antenna or its feeder system to a resistive value suitable to load the transmitter. The wireless range that an end-customer gets out of an RF product with a current-limited power source such as a coin-cell battery depends greatly on the antenna design the enclosure and a good PCB layout.
