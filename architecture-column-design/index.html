<p><strong>Architecture Column Design</strong>, Modern columns and pillars can also be made of less expensive materials such as treated wood fiberglass and PVC. A column or pillar in architecture and structural engineering is a structural element that transmits through compression the weight of the structure above to other structural elements below. There is usually a simple capital of carved mouldings at the top.</p>
