Randomly assigning animals to experimental groups is necessary to prevent bias that can arise when experimenters or pet owners are permitted to choose the treatment for each animal. Fundamental steps in experimental design for animal studies. In our study we evaluated the methodological quality of animal research in critical care journals in 2005 and 2015 and found a significant increase in the reporting of power analyses randomization and sample. Any steps taken to minimise the effects of subjective bias when allocating animals to treatment eg. Experimental design and reporting.</p>
