<p>If the garage door is open the door could fall when you switch to manual mode. Typically the LEDs on the safety sensors will blink to indicate that the problem is an obstruction. However if your garage door has been slamming shut for quite some time it may be damaged beyond repair and needs to be replaced. Some solutions I have heard including fashioning blinders around the sensors or swapping sides so that the receiving eye is at a different angle.</p>
<h3 id="we-purchased-a-garage-door-with-keypad-from-sears-and-have-noticed-that-when-the-door-itself-is-in-the-direct-sunlight---late-morning-all-the-way-until-late-afternoon-you-have-to-hold-down-the-button-on-either-the-keypad-or-the-button-inside-the-garage-by-the-door-to-the-house-until-the-garage-door-is-all-the-way-down---or-else-it-will-act-like-there-is-something-in-the-way-and-start-to-close-but-then-go">We purchased a garage door with keypad from Sears and have noticed that when the door itself is in the direct sunlight - late morning all the way until late afternoon you have to hold down the button on either the keypad or the button inside the garage by the door to the house until the garage door is all the way down - or else it will act like there is something in the way and start to close but then go.</h3><p>A good way to see if this is whats wrong with your door is make sure nothing is blocking the door from closing and hold down the wall mounted button inside your garage. If this works its another sign that the problem is due to a garage door safety sensor issue. Over the past few weeks it was getting touchy but always closed after the first try or so. If you can it is best to disengage the sensors when the garage door is down. Garage door wont close in the morning but closes at night just fine. But will close at night.</p>
