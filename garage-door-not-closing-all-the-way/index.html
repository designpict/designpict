<p>Having done all this you may need to adjust the two limit screws to make sure the door is stopping in the correct places when closing and opening. One of them may be slanted toward the door and binding it. The door will not completely close or reverses halfway down when you use the opener.

<p>If your garage door wont close all the way its probably an issue with your sensors. These sensors detect when small children pets or obstructions block the garage doors path helping to keep everyone safe. If your door has a gap on one side or the other when its closed the problem is most likely due to a break or other issue with one of the extension springs. I disconnected my automatic garage door opener and I can see when closing the door manually and its almost at the bottom the remaining panel gets stuck and it wont fully close.
