<p>Make sure the opener is plugged in and the garage circuit breaker is in the correct place. Make sure your door has not been manually locked by mistake. Check to see if the outlet is working by plugging something else into it or check your fuse box or circuit breaker. The most common reason your garage door opener remote control is not working is the batteries are dead. Pin On The Family Handyman.</p>
