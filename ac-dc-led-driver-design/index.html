<p>This design provides the ability to drive multiple LED strings with current matching from an AC source from 90VAC to 300VAC. I can attach one LED light which accepts 300 mA current of 18 watts or 3 LED lights each of which accept 300 mA current of 6 watts each in series to the driver and it should work. In most applications using a low voltage DC input LED driver is recommended. LED drivers that use high-voltage AC power are called Off-Line drivers or AC LED drivers.
