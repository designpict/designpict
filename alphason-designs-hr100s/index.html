Just when it seemed that every superarm worth the name had thick straight tube construction in the idiom of Linns Ittok Alphasons HR100S appeared in 1983 sporting classic S-shape geometry. Alphason Designs produced a range of turntables tonearms and loudspeakers until the mid 1990s. Which is in turn a member of the Alps Electric Group.
