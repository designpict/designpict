A design that chooses experimental points uniformly scattered on the domain is known as uniform experimental design and uniform experimental design can be regarded as a fractional factorial design with model uncertainty a space-filling design for computer experiments a robust design against the model specification and a supersaturated design and can be applied to experiments with mixtures.
