<p>Various types of ehlers danlos syndrome or eds depend upon the variety of genetic causes few of which are passed on from parent to child. Despite this grouping and their common name, each type is a distinct condition caused by a different gene mutation. Exercises to strengthen the muscles and stabilize joints are the primary treatment for. There are different kinds of genetic mutations that may cause problems with collagen, which is a substance that provides structure and strength to blood vessels, internal organs, skin, and bone.</p>
